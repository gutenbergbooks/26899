<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF CHAUCER NO. V.</h3>

  <p><i>The Arke of Artificial Day</i>.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding, to point out the indelible marks by which Chaucer
  has, as it were, stereotyped the true date of the journey to Canterbury,
  I shall clear away another stumbling-block, still more insurmountable to
  Tyrwhitt than his first difficulty of the "halfe cours" in Aries, viz.
  the seeming inconsistency in statements (1.) and (2.) in the following
  lines of the prologue to the Man of Lawe's tale:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr">
<tr><td>(1.)</td><td><a href="images/$lbrace.png"><img src="images/$lbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:6ex; width:1em" alt="Brace" /></a></td>
<td>

&nbsp;The arke of his artificial day, had ironne<br />
&nbsp;The fourthe part and halfe an houre and more,
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</td></tr>
<tr><td>(2.)</td><td><a href="images/$lbrace.png"><img src="images/$lbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:18ex; width:1em" alt="brace" /></a></td>
<td>
&nbsp;And saw wel that the shadow of every tree<br />
&nbsp;Was as in length of the same quantitie,<br />
&nbsp;That was the body erecte that caused it,<br />
&nbsp;And therefore by the shadow he toke his wit<br />
&nbsp;That Phebus, which that shone so clere and bright,<br />
&nbsp;Degrees was five and fourty clombe on hight,<br />
&nbsp;And for that day, as in that latitude<br />
&nbsp;It was ten of the clok, he gan conclude."
</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The difficulty will be best explained in Tyrwhitt's own
  words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Unfortunately, however, this description, though seemingly intended
  to be so accurate, will neither enable us to conclude with the MSS. that
  it was '<i>ten of the clock</i>,' nor to fix upon any other hour; as the
  two circumstances just mentioned are not found to coincide in any part of
  the 28th, or of any other day of April, in this
  climate."&mdash;<i>Introductory Discourse</i>, ¬ß xiv.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a foot-note, Tyrwhitt further enters into a calculation to show
  that, on the 28th of April, the fourth part of the day and half an hour
  and more (even with the liberal allowance of a quarter of an hour to the
  indefinite phrase '<i>and more</i>') would have been completed by nine
  o'clock <span class="scac">A.M.</span> at the latest, and therefore at
  least an hour too soon for coincidence with (2.).</p>

  <p>Now one would think that Tyrwhitt, when he found his author relating
  facts, "<i>seemingly intended to be so accurate</i>," would have
  endeavoured to discover whether there might not be some hidden meaning in
  them, the explaining of which might make that consistent, which, at
  first, was apparently the reverse.</p>

  <p>Had he investigated with such a spirit, he must have discovered that
  the expression "arke of the artificial day" <i>could not</i>, in this
  instance, receive its obvious and usual meaning, of the horary duration
  from sunrise to sunset&mdash;</p>

  <p>And for this simple reason: That such a meaning would <i>presuppose a
  knowledge of the hour</i>&mdash;of the very thing in request&mdash;and
  which was about <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>{346}</span>to be discovered by "our hoste," who "toke
  his wit" from the sun's altitude for the purpose! But he knew already
  that the fourth part of the day <span class="scac">IN TIME</span> had
  elapsed, he must necessarily have also known what that time was, without
  the necessity of calculating it!</p>

  <p>Now, Chaucer, whose choice of expression on scientific subjects is
  often singularly exact, says, "Our hoste <i>saw</i> that the sonne,"
  &amp;c.; he must therefore have been referring to some visible situation:
  because, afterwards, when the time of day has been obtained from
  calculation, the phrase changes to "<i>gan conclude</i>" that it was ten
  of the clock.</p>

  <p>It seems, therefore, certain that, even setting aside the question of
  consistency between (1.) and (2.), we must, <i>upon other grounds</i>,
  assume that Chaucer had some meaning in the expression "arke of the
  artificial day," different from what must be admitted to be its obvious
  and received signification.</p>

  <p>To what other ark, then, could he have been alluding, if not to the
  <i>horary</i> diurnal ark?</p>

  <p>I think, to the <span class="sc">Azimuthal Arch of the Horizon</span>
  included between the point of sunrise and that of sunset!</p>

  <p>The situation of any point in that arch is called its bearing; it is
  estimated by reference to the points of the compass; it is therefore
  <i>visually</i> ascertainable: and it requires no previous knowledge of
  the hour in order to determine when the sun has completed the fourth, or
  any other, portion of it.</p>

  <p>Here, then, is <i>prim√¢ facie</i> probability established in favour of
  this interpretation. And if, upon examination, we find that it also
  clears away the discrepancy between (1.) and (2.), probability becomes
  certainty.</p>

  <p>Assuming, upon evidence which I shall hereafter explain, that the
  sun's declination, on the day of the journey, was 13¬∞ 26' North, or
  thirteen degrees and half,&mdash;the sun's bearing at rising, in the
  neighbourhood of London, would be E.N.E., at setting W.N.W.; the whole
  included arch, 224¬∞; and the time at which the sun would complete
  one-fourth, or have the bearing, S.E. by E., would be about 20 minutes
  past nine <span class="scac">A.M.</span>,&mdash;thus leaving 40 minutes
  to represent Chaucer's "halfe an hour and more!"</p>

  <p>A very remarkable approximation&mdash;which converts a statement
  apparently contradictory, into a strong confirmation of the deduction to
  be obtained from the other physical facts grouped together by Chaucer
  with such extraordinary skill!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it is impossible to deny that the "hoste's"
  subsequent admonition to the pilgrims to make the best use of their time,
  warning them that "the fourthe partie of this day is gon," seems again to
  favour the idea that it is the day's actual horary duration that is
  alluded to.</p>

  <p>This can be only hypothetically accounted for by observing that in
  this, as in many other instances, Chaucer seems to delight in a sort of
  disguised phraseology; as though to veil his true meaning, and designedly
  to create scientific puzzles to exercise the knowledge and discernment of
  his readers.</p>

<h3>FOREIGN ENGLISH&mdash;GUIDE TO AMSTERDAM.</h3>

  <p>I doubt not many of your readers will have been as much amused as
  myself with the choice specimens of Foreign English enshrined in your
  pages. When at Amsterdam, some years since, I purchased a <i>Guide</i> to
  that city, which I regard as a considerable literary curiosity in the
  same line. It was published at Amsterdam, by E. Maascamp, in 1829, and
  contains from beginning to end a series of broken English, professing all
  the while to be written by an Englishman.</p>

  <p>It commences with the following "Advertisement:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The city of Amsterdam&mdash;remarkable as being one of the chief
  metropoles of Europe, and as being in many respects the general market of
  whole the universe; justly celebrated for&mdash;its large interior
  canals, on both of their sides enlivened and sheltered by ranges of
  large, thick, and beautiful trees, and presenting, on large broad and
  neatly kept, most regularly pav'd quays, long chains of sumptuous
  habitations, or rather palaces of the principal and <i>weathy</i>
  merchants; moreover remarkable by its Museum for the objects of the fine
  arts, &amp;c., its numberless public edifices adapted either to the
  <i>cultivation</i> of arts, or to the exertions of trade, or to
  <i>establishments</i> charitable purposes, or of temples of all manners
  of divine worship&mdash;the city of Amsterdam, we say," &amp;c. It is
  dated "This 15<sup>the</sup> of Juin, 1829."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In page 14. the author gives us an account of his habits,
  &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I live in Amsterdam since some considerable time I drink no strong
  liquors, nor do I smoke tobacco and with all this&mdash;I have not been
  <i>attacked</i> by those agues and fevers w<sup>h</sup> frequently reign
  here from the month of Juin to the end of the autumn: and twenty
  foreigners whom I know, do follow the same system, and are still as
  healthy as I myself; while I have seen a great many of natives taking
  their drams and smoking their pipes <i>ad libitem</i>, and moreover
  <i>chawing</i> tobacco in a quite disgusting manner, who," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An Amsterdam Sunday, p. 42.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On sundays and holydays the shops and warehouses, and, <i>intra
  muros</i>, those of public entertainment are <i>close</i>: the devotees
  go to church, and sanctify the sabbath. Others go to walk outside the
  towngates: after their walk, they hasten to fine public-play-gardens,
  where wine, thea, &amp;c. is sold. Neither the mobility remains idle at
  <i>these</i> entertainments. Every one invites his damsel, and joyously
  they enter play-gardens of a little less brilliancy than the former.

<h3>SEVEN CHILDREN AT A BIRTH THREE TIMES
FOLLOWING.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent N.&nbsp;D.'s papers (Vol. ii., p. 459., and Vol. iii.,
  p. 64) have reminded me of another remarkable instance of fecundity
  related by the well-known civil engineer <span class="sc">Jan Adriaensz.
  Leeg-Water</span>, in his <i>Kleyne Chronycke</i>, printed at Amsterdam
  in 1654:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some years since," says he, p. 31., "I was at <i>Wormer</i>, at an
  inn near the town-hall: the landlady, whose name was <i>Frankjen</i>,
  told me of the Burgomaster of <i>Hoorn</i>, who in the spring went over
  the (Zuyder?) sea to buy oxen, and going into a certain house he found
  seven little children sitting by the fire, each with a porringer in its
  hand, and eating rice-milk, or pap, with a spoon; on which the
  Burgomaster said 'Mother, you are very kind to your neighbours, since
  they leave their children to your care.' 'No,' said the woman, they are
  all my own children, which I had at one birth; and if you will wait a
  moment, I will show you more that will surprise you.' She then fetched
  seven other children <i>a birth</i> older: so she had fourteen children
  at two births. Then the woman said to the Burgomaster, 'I am now
  <i>enceinte</i>, and I think in the same way as before: if you come here
  next year, call upon me again.' And so, the next year, when the
  Burgomaster went over the sea, he called upon the woman and the woman had
  again brought forth seven children at a birth. Thus the woman had at
  three births twenty-one children."</p>

<h3>RAMASSHED, MEANING OF THE TERM.</h3>

  <p>In the curious volume recently edited by Sir Henry Ellis for the
  Camden Society, entitled <i>The Pilgrymage of Syr R. Guylforde,
  Knyght</i>, a singular term occurs, which may claim a note of
  explanation. It is found in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Saterdaye to Suse, Noualassa, and to Lyungborugh; and at the sayd
  Noualassa we toke moyles to stey us vp the mountayne, and toke also
  marones to kepe vs frome fallynge. And from the hyght of the mounte down
  to Lyuyngborugh I was ramasshed, whiche is a right strange
  thinge."&mdash;P. 80.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir Henry has not bestowed upon us here any of those erudite
  annotations, which have customarily enhanced the interest of works edited
  under his care.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Guylforde was on his homeward course from the Holy Places
  by way of Pavia, where he visited the convent and church which contained
  the shrine and relics of St. Augustine, as also the tomb of Lionel, Duke
  of Clarence, second son of Edward III., whose monumental inscription (not
  to be found in Sandford's <i>Genealogical History</i>) the worthy knight
  copied.</p>

  <p>On the 13th Feb. 1506, Sir Richard approached the ascent of Mont Cenis
  by the way of S. Ambrogio and Susa. At the village of Novalese, now in
  ruins, the party took mules, to aid their ascent, and <i>marroni</i>,
  long-handled mattocks, or pick-axes, to prevent their falling on the
  dangerous declivities of the snow. The journey was formerly made with
  frightful expedition by means of a kind of sledge&mdash;an expedient
  termed <i>la ramasse</i>&mdash;which enabled the traveller, previously to
  the construction of that extraordinary road, well known to most readers,
  to effect in a few minutes a perilous descent of upwards of 6000 feet.
  The <i>ramasse</i>, as Cotgrave informs us, was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A kind of high sled, or wheelbarrow, whereon travellers are carried
  downe certaine steep and slippery hils in Piemont."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Its simplest form had probably been a kind of fagot of
  brushwood,&mdash;<i>ramazza</i>, or a besom, not much unlike the rapid
  locomotive of witches, who were called in old times <i>ramassi√®res</i>,
  from their supposed practice of riding on a <i>ram√©e</i>, <i>ramasse</i>,
  or besom. At the present time even, it occasionally occurs that an
  adventurous traveller crossing the Mont Cenis is tempted to glide down
  the rapid descent, in preference to the long course of the zigzag road;
  and remember to have heard at Lauslebourg the tale, doubtless often
  related, of an eccentric <i>Milord</i> who ascended the heights thrice
  from that place, a journey of some hours, for the gratification of the
  repeated excitement caused by a descent on the <i>ramasse</i> in about as
  many minutes. The cranium of a horse, as it was stated, was the vehicle
  often preferred for this curious adventure: and the <!-- Page 348
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>{348}</span>traveller
  guided or steadied his course by trailing a long staff, a practice for
  security well known to the Alpine tourist. This may probably have been
  the use of the "marones" taken by Sir Richard Guyldeford and his party at
  Novalese.</p>

  <p>The terms, to be "ramasshed," is not, as I believe, wholly disused in
  France. It was brought to the metropolis with the strange amusement known
  as the <i>Montagne Russe</i>. In the valuable <i>Compl√©ment du
  Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie</i>, compiled under the direction of Louis
  Barr√©, we find the following phrase:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Se faire ramasser, se dit aujourd'hui, dans une acception
  particuli√®re, pour, Se faire lancer dans un char, du haut des √©l√©vations
  artificielles qui se trouvent dans les jardins publics."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Such a disport had been known previously to the expedition to Moscow,
  and the favourite divertisement <i>√† la Russe</i>, so much in vogue
  amongst the Parisians for a few subsequent years. Roquefort informs us
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Ramasse</i> √©toit le nom d'un jeu que nous avions apport√© des
  Alpes, o√π il est encore en usage pendant l'hiver, et principalement en
  temps de neige."</p>

  <p>Wright, the publisher of the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>, lived at 169.
  Piccadilly, and his shop was the general morning resort of the friends of
  the ministry, as Debrell's was of the oppositionists. About the time when
  the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> was contemplated, Owen, who had been the
  publisher of Burke's pamphlets, failed. The editors of the
  <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> took his house, paying the rent, taxes, &amp;c., and
  gave it up to Wright, reserving to themselves the first floor, to which a
  communication was opened through Wright's house. Being thus enabled to
  pass to their own rooms through Wright's shop, where their frequent
  visits did not excite any remarks, they contrived to escape particular
  observation.</p>

  <p>Their meetings were most regular on Sundays, but they not unfrequently
  met on other days of the week, and in their rooms were chiefly written
  the poetical portions of the work. What was written was generally left
  open upon the table, and as others of the party dropped in, hints or
  suggestions were made; sometimes whole passages were contributed by some
  of the parties present, and afterwards altered by others, so that it is
  almost impossible to ascertain the names of the authors. Where, in the
  above notes, a piece is ascribed to different authors, the conflicting
  statements may arise from incorrect information, but sometimes they arise
  from the whole authorship being assigned to one person, when in fact both
  may have contributed. If we look at the references, vol. ii. pp. 420.
  532. 623., we shall see Mr. Canning naming several authors, whereas Lord
  Burghersh assigns all to one author. Mr. Canning's authority is here more
  to be relied upon. "New Morality" Mr. Canning assigns generally to the
  four contributors; Mr. Wright has given some interesting particulars by
  appropriating to each his peculiar portion.</p>

  <p>Gifford was the working editor, and wrote most of the refutations and
  corrections of the "Lies," "Mistakes," and "Misrepresentations."</p>

  <p>The papers on finance were chiefly by Pitt: the first column was
  frequently for what he might send; but his contributions were uncertain,
  and generally very late, so that the space reserved for him was sometimes
  filled up by other matter. He only once met the editors at Wright's.</p>

  <p>Upcott, who was at the time assistant in Wright's shop, was employed
  as amanuensis, to copy out for the printer the various contributions,
  that the authors' handwriting might not be detected.</p>

  <p><i>Egg and Arrow Ornament.</i>&mdash;Mr. Ruskin, in his <i>Stones of

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Greek egg and arrow cornice is a nonsense cornice, very noble in
  its lines, but utterly absurd in its meaning. Arrows have had nothing to
  do with eggs (at least since Leda's time), neither are the so-called
  arrows like arrows, nor the eggs like eggs, nor the honeysuckles like
  honeysuckles: they are all conventionalized into a monotonous
  successiveness of nothing&mdash;pleasant to the eye, useless to the

</blockquote>

  <p>The ornament of which Mr. R. thus speaks is indifferently called egg
  and tongue, egg and dart, as well as egg and arrow. It seems to me that
  the <i>egg</i> is a complete misnomer, although common to all the
  designations; and I fancy that the idea of what is so called was
  originally derived from the full-length shield, and therefore that the
  ornament should be named the <i>shield and dart</i>, an association more
  reasonable than is suggested by any of the ordinary appellations. Can any

  <p><i>Defoe's Project for purifying the English Language.</i>&mdash;Among
  the many schemes propounded by De Foe, in his <i>Essay upon Projects</i>,
  published in 1696, there is one which still remains a theory, although
  eminently practicable, and well worthy of consideration.</p>

  <p>He conceived that there might be an academy or society formed for the
  purpose of correcting, purifying, and establishing the English language,
  such as had been founded in France under Cardinal Richelieu.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The work of this society," says Defoe, "should be to encourage polite
  learning, to polish and refine the English tongue, and advance the so
  much neglected faculty of correct language; also, to establish purity and
  propriety of style, and to purge it from all the irregular additions that
  ignorance and affectation have introduced; and all these innovations of
  speech, if I may call them such, which some dogmatic writers have the
  confidence to foster upon their native language, as if their authority
  were sufficient to make their own fancy legitimate."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Never was such society more needed than in the present day, when you
  can scarcely take up a newspaper, or a periodical, a new poem, or any
  modern literary production, without finding some new-coined word,
  perplexing to the present reader, and a perfect stumbling-block in the
  way of any future editor.</p>

  <p>Some of these words are, I admit, a welcome addition to our common
  stock, but the greater part of them are mere abortions, having no analogy
  to any given root.</p>

  <p>A society similar to the one proposed by Defoe might soon be
  established in this country, if a few such efficient authorities as Dr.
  Kennedy would take the initiative in the movement.</p>

  <p>He who should first establish such a society, and bring it to a
  practicable bearing, would be conferring an inestimable boon on
  society.</p>

  <p>I trust that these hints may serve to arouse the attention of some of
  the many talented contributors to the "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>," and in due season bring forth fruit.</p>

  <p><i>Great Fire of London</i>.&mdash;Our popular histories of England,
  generally, contain very indefinite statements respecting the extent of
  destruction wrought upon the city of London by the Great Fire. I have
  therefore thought it may be interesting to others, as it has been to
  myself, to peruse the following, which purports to be "extracted from the
  Certificates of the Surveyors soon after appointed to survey the
  Ruins."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the fire that began in London upon the second of September,
  1666, at one Mr. Farryner's house, a baker in Pudding Lane, between the
  hours of one and two in the morning, and continued burning until the
  sixth of that month, did overrun the space of three hundred and
  seventy-three acres within the walls of the city of London, and
  sixty-three acres three roods without the walls. There remained
  seventy-five acres three roods standing within the walls unburnt.
  Eighty-nine parish churches, besides chappels burnt. Eleven parishes
  within the walls standing. Houses burnt, Thirteen thousand two
  hundred.</p>

<h3>PASSAGES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ILLUSTRATED
FROM DEMOSTHENES.</h3>

  <p>Acts xvii. 21.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time
  in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can any of your biblical correspondents inform me in what commentary
  upon the New Testament the coincidence with the following passages in
  Demosthenes is noticed, or whether any other source of the historical
  fact has been recorded? In the translation of Petrus Lagnerius, Franc.
  1610 (I have not at hand the entire works), we find these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nihil est omnium, Athenienses, in pr√¶senti√¢ nocentius, quam quod vos
  alienati estis a rebus, et tantisper operam datis, dum audientes sedetis,
  si quid Novi nuntiatum fuerit" (4. contr. <i>Phil</i>.).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  cunctabundi, tum decernentes, tum interrogantes, si quid Novi in foro

</blockquote>

  <p>Pric√¶us, in his very learned and valuable <i>Commentarii in varios
  N.T. Libros</i>, Lond. 1660, fol., at p. 628, in v. 21., says
  only&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Matthew xiii. 14.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
  hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see,
  and shall not perceive."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This proverb seems to have been common to all ages and countries. It
  is of frequent occurrence in the New Testament (Mark iv. 12.; viii. 18.;
  John xii. 40.; Acts xxviii. 25.; Romans xi. 8.), and, as in Matthew, is
  referred to Isaiah. But, in the Old Testament, there is earlier authority
  for its use in Deuteronomy xxix. 4. It occurs also in Jeremiah v. 21.; in
  Ezekiel xii. 2., and, with a somewhat different application, in the
  Psalms, cxv. 5.; cxxxv. 16.</p>

  <p>That it was employed as an established proverb by Demosthenes seems to
  have been generally overlooked. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is quoted, however, by Pric√¶us (p. 97.), who also supplies exactly
  corresponding passages from Maximus Tyrius (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 190), Plutarch (<span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  107-20), and Philo (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 41). Of these, the
  last only can have been prior to the publication of St. Matthew's Gospel,
  which Saxius places, at the earliest, in the reign of Claudius.</p>

  <p>Hugo Grotius has no reference to Demosthenes in his <i>Annotationes in
  Vet. Test.,</i> Vogel &amp; Doderein, 1776; but cites Heraclitus the
  Ephesian, who, according to Saxius, flourished in the year 502 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and Aristides, who, on the same authority,
  lived in the 126th year of the Christian era. Has any other commentator
  besides Pric√¶us alluded to the passage in Demosthenes?</p>

<h3>THE HOUSE OF MAILL√â.</h3>

  <p>The house of Maill√© (vide Lord Mahon's <i>Life of Cond√©</i>)
  contributed to the Crusades one of its bravest champions. Can any of your
  numerous contributors give me information as to the name and achievements
  of the Crusader?</p>

  <p>Claire Cl√©mence de Maill√©, daughter of the Mar√©chal Duke de Brez√©, and
  niece of Richelieu, was married in 1641 to the Duc d'Enghien, afterwards
  the Great Cond√©; and Lord Mahon, somewhere in his life of the hero, makes
  mention of the princess as the "last of her family."</p>

  <p>Claire Cl√©mence had an only brother, who held the exalted post of High
  Admiral of France, and in 1646 he commanded a French fleet which
  disembarked 8000 men in the marshes of Sienna, and himself shortly
  afterwards fell at the siege of Orbitello. The admiral having died
  unmarried, the Brez√© estates became the property of the princess, who
  transmitted them to her descendants, the last of whom was the unfortunate
  Duc d'Enghien, who perished at Vincennes.</p>

  <p>Thus much is patent; but I think it probable his lordship was not
  aware that a branch of the family was exiled, and with the La Touches, La
  Bertouches, &amp;c., settled in the sister kingdom, most likely at the
  Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Their descendants subsequently passed
  over into this country, and have contributed to the lists of the legal
  and medical professions. Up to the present century a gentleman bearing
  the slightly altered name of Malli√© held a commission in the British
  army. Even now, the family is not extinct, and the writer being lately on
  a visit to a lady, probably the sole representative <i>in name</i> of
  this once powerful house, noticed in her possession a series of four
  small engravings, representing the Great Cond√©; his mother, a princess of
  Montmorency, pronounced to be the "handsomest woman in Europe;" the old
  Mar√©chal de Maill√© Brez√©; and his daughter, Claire Cl√©mence.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Pall Mall</i> is, I believe, derived from <i>Pail√©e Maill√©</i>,
  a game somewhat analogous to cricket, and imported from France in the
  reign of the second Charles: it was formerly played in St. James's Park,
  and in the exercise of the sport a small hammer or <i>mallet</i> was used
  to strike the ball. I think it worth noting that the <i>Malli√©</i> crest
  <i>is</i> a mailed arm and hand, the latter grasping a <i>mallet</i>.</p>

  <p>Be it understood that the writer has no pretensions to a knowledge of
  heraldic terms and devices; so, without pinning any argument on the
  coincidence, he thought it not without interest. He is aware that the
  mere fact of a similarity between surnames and crests is not without its
  parallel in English families.</p>

  But his primary reason, founded on a fac-simile extract from the

  of <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>{352}</span>Ireland, printed, with fac-simile, in the
  second <i>Report of the Commissioners on Irish Records</i>, 1812, p.

  <p>"It is remarkable that the printed copy should differ from the

  latter is doubtless correct; for an engraver, who copies precisely what

  <p><i>Laurence Howel, the Original Pilgrim.</i>&mdash;The unfortunate

  Pilgrim, a Divine Dialogue, showing the most compendious Way to arrive at
  the Love of God. Rendered into English, and explained, with Notes.</i> By
  Laurence Howel, A.M. London; printed by William Redmayne, for the Author,
  1717. In the preface he tells us, that the work was originally written in
  Spanish; afterwards translated into Italian, French, High-Dutch and
  Low-Dutch, and about the year 1587 into Latin from the High-Dutch, by
  Laurentius Surius. There were subsequently two more Latin versions: one
  by Vander Meer, from the French and Dutch copies, compared with the
  original; and another by Antonius Boetzer in 1617. The author's name, he
  says, was unknown to all the editors, and the several editions had
  different titles; by some it was called the <i>Treasure of Devotion</i>,
  by others the <i>Compendious Way to Salvation</i>. The last, however
  (Boetzer's, I presume), bears that of <i>Desiderius</i>. As this was the
  author's title, Mr. Howel adopted it for his translation, adding, he
  says, that of the <i>Original Pilgrim</i>, to distinguish it from others
  of the same name, or very like it. He there informs us that Mr. Royston
  (the distinguished publisher in Charles II.'s and James II.'s reigns) had
  declared that Bishop Patrick took his <i>Parable of the Pilgrim</i> from
  it, and that it had formed the ground-work of the writings of many
  authors in that style.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers give me the titles of the editions in Spanish,
  or any language, of this interesting little book? I should be much
  obliged for any information regarding it. Is Howel's little translation

<h3>THE FAMILY OF THE TRADESCANTS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 119. 286.)</p>

  <p>The family of the Tradescants is involved in considerable obscurity,
  and the period of the arrival of the first of that name in England is
  not, for a certainty, known. There were, it seems, three of the
  Tradescants at one time in this country&mdash;grandfather, father, and
  son. John Tradescant (or Tradeskin, as he was generally called by his
  contemporaries) the elder was, according to Anthony Wood, a Fleming or a
  Dutchman. He probably came to England about the latter end of the reign
  of Elizabeth, or in the beginning of that of James the First. He is
  reported to have been a great traveller, and to have previously visited
  Barbary, Greece, Egypt, and other Eastern countries. Upon his first
  arrival here he is said to have been successively gardener to the Lord
  Treasurer Salisbury, Lord Weston, the Duke of Buckingham, and other
  noblemen of distinction. In these situations he remained until the office
  of royal gardener was bestowed upon him in 1629.</p>

  <p>To John Tradescant the elder, posterity is mainly indebted for the
  introduction of botany in this kingdom. "He, by great industry, made it
  manifest that there is scarcely any plant existing in the known world,
  that will not, with proper care, thrive in our climate." In a visit made
  by Sir W. Watson and Dr. Mitchell to Tradescant's garden in 1749, an
  account of which is inserted in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
  vol. xlvi. p. 160., it appears that it had been many years totally
  neglected, and the house belonging to it empty and ruined; but though the
  garden was quite covered with weeds, there remained among them manifest
  footsteps of its founder. They found there the <i>Borago latifolia
  sempervivens</i> of Caspar Bauhine; <i>Polygonatum vulgare
  latifolium</i>, C.B.; <i>Aristolochia clematitis recta</i>, C.B.; and the
  <i>Dracontium</i> of Dodoens. There were then remaining two trees of the
  <i>Arbutus</i>, which from their being so long used to our winters, did
  not suffer from the severe cold of 1739-40, when most of their kind were
  killed in England. In the orchard there was a tree of the <i>Rhamnus
  catharticus</i>, about twenty feet high, and nearly a foot in diameter.
  There are at present no traces of this garden remaining.</p>

  <p>In the Ashmolean Library is preserved (No. 1461.) a folio manuscript
  (probably in the handwriting of the elder Tradescant) which purports to
  be "The Tradescants' Orchard, illustrated in sixty-five coloured drawings
  of fruits, exhibiting various kinds of the apple, cherry, damson, date,
  <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page354"></a>{354}</span>gooseberry, peares, peaches, plums,
  nectarines, grape, Hasell-nutt, quince, strawberry, with the times of
  their ripening."</p>

  <p>Old John Tradescant died in the year 1652, at which period he was
  probably far advanced in years, leaving behind him a son (also of the
  same name) who seems to have inherited his father's talents and
  enthusiasm. There is a tradition that John Tradescant the younger entered
  himself on board a privateer going against the Algerines, that he might
  have an opportunity of bringing apricot-trees from that country. He is
  known to have taken a voyage to Virginia, whence he returned with many
  new plants. The two Tradescants were the means of introducing a variety
  of curious species into this kingdom, several of which bore their name.
  Tradescants' <i>Spiderwort</i> and <i>Aster</i> are well known to this
  day, and Linn√¶us has immortalised them among the botanists by making a
  new genus under their names of the <i>Spiderwort</i>, which had been
  before called <i>Ephemeron</i>.</p>

  <p>When the elder Tradescant first settled in England, he formed a
  curious collection of natural history, coins, medals, and a great variety
  of "uncommon rarities." A catalogue of them was published in 12mo. in the
  year 1656, by his son, under the name of <i>Museum Tradescantianum</i>;
  to which are prefixed portraits, both of the father and son, by Hollar.
  This Museum or "Ark," as it was termed, was frequently visited by persons
  of rank, who became benefactors thereto; among these were Charles the
  First, Henrietta Maria (his queen), Archbishop Laud, George Duke of
  Buckingham, Robert and William Cecil, Earls of Salisbury, and many other
  persons of distinction: among them also appears the philosophic John
  Evelyn, who in his <i>Diary</i> has the following notice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sept. 17, 1657, I went to see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a
  relation of mine, and thence to John Tradescant's museum."</p>

</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus John Tradeskin starves our wondering eyes</p>
      <p>By boxing up his new-found rarities."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Ashmole, in his <i>Diary</i> (first published by Charles Burman in
  1717), has three significant entries relating to the subject of our
  notice, which I transcribe <i>verbatim</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Decem. 12, 1659. Mr. Tredescant and his wife told me they had been
  long considering upon whom to bestow their closet of curiosities when
  they died, and at last had resolved to give it unto me.</p>

  <p>"April 22, 1662. Mr. John Tredescant died.</p>

  <p>"May 30, 1662. This Easter term I preferred a bill in Chancery against
  Mrs. Tredescant, for the rarities her husband had settled on me."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The success of Ashmole's suit is well known; but the whole transaction
  reflects anything but honour upon his name. The loss of her husband's
  treasures probably preyed upon the mind of Mrs. Tradescant; for in the
  <i>Diary</i> before quoted, under April 4, 1678, Ashmole says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My wife told me that Mrs. Tradescant was found drowned in her pond.
  She was drowned the day before at noon, as appears by some
  circumstance."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was the same Hesther Tradescant who erected the Tradescant
  monument in Lambeth churchyard. She was buried in the vault where her
  husband and his son John (who "died in his spring") had been formerly
  laid.</p>

  <p>The table monument to the memory of the Tradescants was erected in
  1662. The sculptures on the four sides are as follows, viz. on the
  <i>north</i>, a crocodile, shells, &amp;c., and a view of some Egyptian
  buildings; on the <i>south</i>, broken columns, Corinthian capitals,
  &amp;c., supposed to be ruins in Greece, or some Eastern country; on the
  <i>east</i>, Tradescant's arms, on a bend three fleurs-de-lys, impaling a
  lion passant; on the <i>west</i>, a hydra, and under it a skull; various
  figures of trees, &amp;c., in relievo, adorn the four corners of the
  tomb; over it is placed a handsome tablet of black marble. The monument,
  by the contribution of some friends to their memory, was in the year 1773
  repaired, and (according to Sir John Hawkins) the following lines,
  "<i>formerly</i> intended for an epitaph, inserted thereon." Other
  authorities say that they were merely <i>restored</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Know, stranger, ere thou pass beneath this stone,</p>
      <p>Lye John Tradescant, grandsire, father, son;</p>
      <p>The last dy'd in his spring; the other two</p>
      <p>Liv'd till they had travell'd Art and Nature through,</p>
      <p>As by their choice collections may appear,</p>
      <p>Of what is rare, in land, in sea, in air;</p>
      <p>Whilst they (as Homer's <i>Iliad</i> in a nut)</p>
      <p>A world of wonders in one closet shut;</p>
      <p>These famous antiquarians that had been</p>
      <p><i>Both Gardeners to the Rose and Lily Queen</i>,</p>
      <p>Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when</p>
      <p>Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,</p>
      <p>And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,</p>
      <p>And change this garden for a Paradise."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A number of important errors concerning this once celebrated family
  have been made by different writers. Sir John Hawkins, in a note to his
  edition of Walton's <i>Angler</i> (edit. 1792, p. 24.), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There were, it seems, three of the Tradescants, grandfather, father,
  and son: the son is the person here meant: the two former were gardeners
  to Queen Elizabeth, and the latter to King Charles I."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The epitaph above quoted satisfactorily proves, I think, that the
  Tradescants were never gardeners to the maiden Queen. "The rose and lily
  queen" was certainly Henrietta Maria, the queen of Charles the First. I
  have now before me (from the cabinet of a friend) a small silver medal
  struck to commemorate the marriage of Charles the First. It has on the
  obverse the busts of Charles and Henrietta, the sun shining from the
  clouds above <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>{355}</span>them: the inscription is CH: MAG: ET: HEN:
  MA: BRIT: REX: ET: REG. The reverse contains in the field, Cupid mixing
  <i>lilies with roses</i>; the legend being FVNDIT: AMOR: LILIA: MIXTA:
  ROSIS. In the exergue is the date 1625. The Tradescant mentioned by
  Walton in 1653 was the <i>second</i> of that name, not the son, as stated
  by Sir John Hawkins.</p>

  <p>The editor of the last edition of Evelyn's <i>Diary</i> (vol. ii. p.
  414.) says, speaking of the Tradescants:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They were all eminent gardeners, travellers, and collectors of
  curiosities. The two first came into this country in the reign of James
  I., and the second and third were employed in the Royal Gardens by
  Charles I."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here is a <i>positive</i> statement that the elder Tradescant and his
  son came into England in the reign of <i>James I.</i> But there is no
  <i>proof</i> of this given. It is merely the writer's assertion. At the
  end of the same note, speaking of Tradescant's Ark, the editor
  observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, and a
  catalogue of its contents was printed by the youngest John Tradescant in
  1656, with the title of <i>Museum Tradescantianum</i>. He died in
  1652."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was not the <i>youngest</i> John Tradescant that died in 1652, but
  the <i>oldest</i>, the <i>grandfather</i>&mdash;the first of that name
  that settled in England.</p>

  <p>The following is a list of the portraits of the Tradescant family now
  in the Ashmolean Museum; both father and son are in these portraits
  called <i>Sir</i> John, though it does not appear that either of them was
  ever knighted. Mr. Black, in his excellent catalogue of the Ashmolean
  Library, also calls the elder Tradescant <i>Sir</i> John. (See p.
  1266.)</p>

  <p>1. Sir John Tradescant, sen., three-quarter size, ornamented with
  fruit, flowers, and garden roots.</p>

  <p>2. The same, after his decease.</p>

  <p>3. The same, a small three-quarter piece, in water colours.</p>

  <p>4. A large painting of his wife, son, and daughter,
  quarter-length.</p>

  <p>5. Sir John Tradescant, junior, in his garden, with a spade in his
  hand, half-length.</p>

  <p>6. The same with his wife, half-length.</p>

  <p>7. The same, with his friend Zythepsa of Lambeth, a collection of
  shells, &amp;c. upon a table before them.</p>

  <p>8. A large quarter piece inscribed Sir John Tradescant's second wife
  and son.</p>

  <p>Granger says he saw a picture at a gentleman's house in Wiltshire,
  which was not unlike that of the deceased Tradescant, and the inscription
  was applicable to it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mortuus haud alio quam quo pater ore quiesti,</p>
      <p>Quam facili frueris nunc quoque nocte doces."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I may add, in conclusion, that several beautiful drawings of the
  Tradescant monument in Lambeth churchyard are preserved in the Pepysian
  library. These drawings were engraved for the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i>, vol. lxiii. p. 88.; and are printed from the same
  plates in the <i>Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</i>, vol. ii.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF VENVILLE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 152. 310.)</p>

  <p>I observe, in p. 310. of the present volume, that two correspondents,
  P. and K., have contributed conjectures as to the meaning and origin of
  the term <i>venville</i>, noticed and explained <i>ant√®</i>, p. 152. The
  <i>origin</i> of the word is of course to some extent open to conjecture;
  but they may rest assured that the <i>meaning</i> of it is not, nor ever
  has been, within the domain of mere conjecture with those who have had
  any opportunities of inquiry in the proper quarter. The term has not the
  slightest reference to the ceremony of delivering possession, which P.
  has evidently witnessed in the case of his father, and which lawyers call
  livery of seisin; nor is there on Dartmoor any such word as <i>ven</i>
  signifying peat, or as <i>fail</i>, signifying turf. No doubt a fen on
  the moor would probably contain "black earth or peat," like most other
  mountain bogs; and if (as K. says) <i>fail</i> means a "turf or flat
  clod" in Scotland, I think it probable that a Scotchman on Dartmoor might
  now and then so far forget himself as to call peat or turf by a name
  which would certainly not be understood by an aboriginal Devonian. The
  local name of the peat or other turf cut for fuel is <i>vaggs</i>, and
  this has perhaps been confounded in the recollection of K.'s informant
  with <i>ven</i>. At all events, I can assure both P. and K. (who, I
  presume, are not familiar with the district) that the tenants of venville
  lands have no functions to perform, as such, in any degree connected with
  either turf-cutting, or "fenging fields," and that they do not
  necessarily, or generally, occupy peat districts, or rejoice in</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All the infections that the sun sucks up</p>
      <p>From bogs, fens, flats," &amp;c.;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>but, on the contrary, they are the owners of some of the most
  valuable, salubrious, and picturesque purlieus of the forest. With regard
  to the name "fengfield," although I am pretty familiar with the records
  of the forest extant for the last five hundred years past, I do not
  remember that it is ever so named or spelt in the muniments of the manor
  or forest. It is so written by Risdon, and in some few other documents
  entitled to little weight, and from which no safe inference can be drawn.
  Whatever be the etymological origin of the term, it should be assumed as
  indisputable by any one who may hereafter exercise his ingenuity or his
  fancy upon it, that the four most prominent <!-- Page 356 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>{356}</span>incidents to the tenure
  are&mdash;1. payment of fines; 2. situation in an ancient vill; 3.
  attendance on the lord's court; 4. enjoyment of certain rights of common.
  It may be that neither the <i>fine</i> nor the <i>vill</i> forms a
  component part of the name; but K. need have no scruple in believing that
  an abbreviated Latin or "legal term" (invented, of course, by the
  stewards or bailiffs of the lord) may have become naturalised among those
  of the inhabitants of the Moor whom it concerns. The tenants or retainers
  of a manor have no alternative but to submit to any generic name by which
  the steward may please to distinguish them. Thus the "priors" and
  "censors" of Dartmoor forest are content to be called by those names,
  because they were designated as "prehurdarii" and "censarii" in the court
  rolls some hundred years ago. The tenants of a certain lordship in
  Cornwall know and convey their tenements by the name of <i>landams</i> to
  this day, merely because the stewards two hundred years ago, when the
  court rolls were in Latin, well knowing that <i>landa</i> was the Latin
  for <i>land</i>, and that transitive verbs in that language require an
  accusative case, recorded each tenant as having taken of the lord "unam
  landam, vocatam Tregollup," &amp;c. Indeed so easily does a clipt exotic
  take root and become acclimated among the peasantry of the Moor, whose
  powers of appropriation are so much disparaged by the sceptical doubts of
  K., that since the establishment of local courts the terms <i>fifa</i>
  and <i>casa</i> have become familiar to them as household words and the
  name and uses of that article of abbreviated Latinity called a
  '<i>bus</i> are, as I am credibly informed, not unknown to them.</p>

  remotely I do not know. They were very easily fattened, but always of
  small size; and I think, unless my memory much deceives me, on removing
  the horny portion of the hoof, the rudiments of a cloven hoof, like that
  of the ordinary swine, were to be seen.</p>

  <p>It would appear, however, by the subsequent quotation from Brand's

  <p><i>Emendation of a Passage in Virgil</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  237.).&mdash;The emendation of <span class="sc">Scriblerus</span> is
  certainly objectionable, and by no means satisfactory, for these
  reasons:&mdash;1st. "Ac sunt in spatio" is by no means elegant Latin,
  which "addunt se in spatia" is; for the word "addunt" is constantly used
  in the same way elsewhere.</p>

  <p>2nd. The word "spatium" is seldom used to signify a chariot
  course.</p>

  <p>"Spatia," the plural, was the proper expression, and is only so
  deviated from in poetry in a single instance. (Juv. <i>Sat.</i> vi. 582.)
  It is used in <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>the plural in Virg. <i>√Ün</i>. v. 316.
  325. 327.; Statius, <i>Theb.</i> vi. 594.; Horace, <i>Epist.</i> 1. xiv.
  9.</p>

  <p><i>Vide</i> Smith's <i>Dictionary of Antiquities</i>, under art.
  Circus, p. 232.</p>

  <p>Surely there is nothing unintelligible in the expression, "addunt se
  in spatia," which is the reading given in almost all the best
  editions.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Archdeacon Cotton, whose endeavours to ascertain and record the
  succession of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies in Ireland
  are probably known to many of our readers (at least, by the Queries which
  have appeared in our Columns), has just completed his <i>Fasti Ecclesi√¶
  Hiberni√¶</i>, in 4 vols. 8vo. From the nature of the work, it is obvious
  that it could never have been undertaken with a view to profit. The
  printing, &amp;c., has cost upwards of six hundred pounds, and the
  Archdeacon, naturally unwilling to lose the whole of this outlay, is
  circulating a prospectus offering copies at fifty shillings the set. Of
  these, there are but two hundred. The utility of a book which contains
  the names and preferments of every occupant of an Irish see, dignity, or
  prebend, from the earliest period to the present day, so far as existing
  materials permits, is so obvious, that it can scarcely be doubted that it
  must eventually find a place in all public and official libraries.</p>

  <p>"<i>A lover and a student of all that is interesting or curious in
